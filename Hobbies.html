<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p> I love music. I used to play drums in band before. I also play guitars and some keyboard. I like art. Drawing, paintings, mostly sketchs. I like being creative and art satisfies me. I also like fun activing that requires physical and mental strength, not hiking and watching sunsets but something for active and exciting.</p>
