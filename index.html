        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I am a quick learner and deep thinker. I believe I am really good at focusing on details and noticing small things that are easy to be over looked. My nautre of noticing small details helps me to learn quick. I am an artistic guy who also likes puzzle solving and creating something piece by piece and turning it into a bigger much valueable thing give me satisfaction. This is why I like coding, small set of codes when put together can create a fully functional application that can be helpful, valueable, and aesthetic for users.</p>
